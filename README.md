# File System Event Notification (fsnotify)

A **portable, robust, and stream-based file system event notification API** for
**Linux, macOS, and Windows**. This library provides a streaming alternative to
the [`fsnotify`](https://github.com/fsnotify/fsnotify) package.

The **portable module** offers a consistent, cross-platform interfaceâ€”the
common denominator across all supported systems. For platform-specific needs,
dedicated modules expose more extensive APIs that leverage each operating
systemâ€™s native capabilities.
